## A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) From Scratch With Python - Part 2

### Prerequisites
You must have Numpy (for math computations)

### Project Structure
Install [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), the only dependency, if you need to:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run it with no arguments:

```bash
$ python cnn.py
$ python cnn_keras.py
```
